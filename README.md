 # About Project
  
	This software provides two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as saving account
	and the other as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and withdrawal
	facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque book facility but
	no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum balance and if the balance
	falls below this level, a service charge is imposed.

	In this software their is a class account that stores customer name, account number and type of account.
	From this, derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their
	requirements. 

	Features:
	---------
	(a) Accept deposit from a customer and update the balance.
	(b) Display the balance.
	(c) Compute and deposit interest.
	(d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
	(e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary, and update the balance.

	Disadvantages:
	--------------
	(a) Can Manage only one customer activity
	(b) No database and File Handling is used, So data is temporary
